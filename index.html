                        ○ Assessed feasibility of modern messaging systems in vehicular
                        communications.
                        ○ Employed Kafka and RabbitMQ to fulfill advanced V2X(Vehicle to everything)
                        applications.
                        ○ Evaluated the feasibility of the design by developing prototype
                        applications to provide performance predictions.
